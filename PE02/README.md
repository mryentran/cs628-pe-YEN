This program I need to build 1 component which is move lists intp the MovieList.js
then I create the file Movie.js to show all the movie in the movie lists
the file MovieCard.css to design how single movie show on the web
in the MovieList.js file, I also use that to create the select option to sort which genre movie you want to see. 
And with the click on feature I add it into the Movie.js
