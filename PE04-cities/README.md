Users can navigate between pages using the menu at the top. On the Add City page, they can enter a city name, country, and population. Once they submit the form, the new city appears in the Cities List. From there, users can click on a city to view more details about it. Since AddCity and CitiesList are separate components, the cities state is stored in App.js and passed as props. When a user adds a new city, the state updates in App.js, and the user is redirected to the Cities List page, where the updated list is displayed. When a user clicks on a city, they are redirected to /city/:id. The City Detail component extracts the city ID from the URL and finds the matching city from the list. React Router ensures smooth navigation without reloading the page, making the experience seamless and interactive.
